# @common-pattern/lint

Lint rules for conventions that are easy to state and easy to forget.

Writing a convention down helps for a while; a linter is the version that still
works in six months, and in code nobody remembers writing.

MIT licensed, and not specific to any one codebase — each rule encodes a
mistake that is general to JavaScript and TypeScript, with the reasoning in a
comment at the top of the file.

## One flavour, two hosts

The rules are plain **ESLint rule objects**. Oxlint's JS plugin host implements
the ESLint v9 rule API, so the same files run under **oxlint or ESLint**
unmodified — nothing in them imports from either.

That portability is the point, not a bonus. Oxlint's plugin API is alpha and has
no semver, so a rule set that could only ever run under oxlint would be trading
one lock-in for another. These move to ESLint by changing the config that loads
them, and nothing else.

> **Previously there was a GritQL flavour for Biome.** It was removed in 0.3.0.
> It could only ever carry three of the rules — GritQL has no scope resolution
> and cannot match comments at all — and keeping two implementations of one rule
> in step is how a rule set drifts. Consumers on `biome/all.grit` should move
> their `biome.json` `plugins` entry to an oxlint `jsPlugins` entry; see
> [With oxlint](#with-oxlint). Biome remains a fine formatter and linter
> alongside it — it simply no longer hosts these rules.

### `no-utc-calendar-day`

Bans `.toISOString().slice(…)` and `.toISOString().split(…)` — deriving a
calendar date from an instant by string surgery.

It reads as "today". It means *the UTC calendar day*, which is a different day
from the user's for a window as wide as their UTC offset: 05:30 every morning
in `Asia/Kolkata`, the whole evening in the Americas. That value then gets
compared against a `date` column holding a local calendar date, and the
comparison runs across two different calendars.

This one is unusually good at hiding. Test suites commonly pin `TZ=UTC`,
production is commonly a UTC datacentre, and nobody develops at 03:00 — so the
expression is correct in every context anyone inspects it in, and wrong only in
the answer given to the user.

**Both spellings are one rule on purpose.** `.toISOString().split("T")[0]` is
the same bug in different clothes, and in one codebase it survived months of
the `.slice` ban precisely because the rule looked like it covered the class and
covered one spelling of it. `[1]` is no better than `[0]` — that is the UTC wall
clock. The receiver is what makes this unambiguous, so there is no check on the
arguments: `formatInTimeZone(instant, tz, "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm").split(" ")` has
already chosen a zone and stays legal.

### `no-glued-timestamps`

Bans `` `${dayKey}T00:00:00Z` `` and its noon-anchored cousin
`` `${dayKey}T12:00:00Z` ``, which hide two different mistakes.

**The interpolation hides the timezone question.** A glued
`` `${date}T00:00:00` `` with no `Z` parses in whatever zone the runtime is in
— the server's, not the user's. `toDate(date, { timeZone })` has nowhere to put
that mistake, because the zone is a required argument rather than an accident
of deployment.

**The noon anchor hides a category error.** It exists because
`` `${key}T00:00:00Z` `` renders as the *previous* day west of UTC, so someone
moved the anchor to noon to buy ±12h of slack. That is a fix sized to the zones
its author had in mind: at UTC+13/+14 (`Pacific/Apia`, `Pacific/Kiritimati`)
noon UTC is already the next day and it renders tomorrow. The deeper problem is
that a day key has no instant behind it at all — "28 July" is a calendar fact,
not a moment — so asking which zone to project it into is the wrong question.

**It also bans the offset variant** — `` new Date(`${wallClock}+05:30`) `` and
`` toDate(`${wallClock}-08:00`, { timeZone }) ``. This is the same habit with
the zone spelled as a number, and it is more tempting because it looks
deliberate: the author obviously thought about timezones. What they wrote down
is a fact with an expiry date. An offset is the tz database's *current answer*
for a zone, not the zone itself — Egypt reinstated DST in 2023, and Chile,
Morocco and Samoa have all moved — and when one changes, an IANA name is a
package update while a literal offset is a code edit nobody knows to make.

The `toDate` form fails a second way worth its own message: an embedded offset
takes **precedence** over the `timeZone` option, so the zone argument isn't
merely redundant, it is silently discarded.

**It also bans the `TZDate` variant** — `` new TZDate(`${date}T${time}:00`, tz) ``
and its `+`-concatenated equivalent. `@date-fns/tz` gives `TZDate` two
constructors that look interchangeable and are not: `new TZDate(string, zone)`
parses the string in the **ambient** zone (the browser's, or the datacentre's)
and only re-tags the result for display, while
`TZDate.tz(zone, year, monthIndex, day, hours, minutes)` reads calendar
components *in that zone*. So the glued form is wrong by the tenant's UTC offset
while reading as the careful, zone-aware thing to do — measured at +5:30 for an
IST org, where 9:30 PM was stored as 21:30Z and rendered back as 3:00 AM the
next day. The named zone in the call is what makes it convincing: the author
demonstrably thought about timezones and still got the opposite of what they
asked for.

This does **not** ban the string constructor. `new TZDate(iso, zone)` over an
unambiguous ISO string carrying a `Z` is legitimate — it parses as UTC whatever
the ambient zone is, and the zone argument only chooses how it renders. Only a
string *glued at the call site* is banned, because that string carries no zone
and therefore inherits one by accident. Two limits keep it honest: only the
two-argument form matches (a one-argument `new TZDate(x)` has no zone to be
wrong about), and the concatenation branch requires a **string literal** operand
so that `new TZDate(base + offsetMs, zone)` — ordinary epoch arithmetic through
the millisecond constructor — stays legal.

Matches call shapes (`new Date(…)`, `fromZonedTime(…)`, `formatDateTime(…)`,
`new TZDate(…, zone)`, and `toDate(…)` for the offset form) rather than every
template literal. The offset branches are deliberately scoped to
`new Date`/`toDate`: `` `${x}-10:30` `` is not inherently date-shaped — it could
be a range label — so the enclosing call is what makes the intent unambiguous.

Not matched, and deliberately legal: `` `${date}T${time}` `` **as a wire
value**, joining two already-validated fields into a string that is about to be
sent somewhere. There is no instant and no zone in it. Passed to a date
function, though, it is a bug — which is what the next rule is for.

> half may be a variable.

### `no-glued-timestamp-via-variable`

Bans the same glued timestamp when it reaches a
timezone-sensitive consumer *through a variable*:

```ts
const startStr = `${dateStr}T${normalizedTime}`;
const startDate = fromZonedTime(startStr, timezone);   // reported here
```

This is the case `no-glued-timestamps` gives up on, and it needs scope
resolution to do safely. Without it, a pattern matching an interpolated
assignment plus a use of that name can only match **by name across the whole
file**: a `value`
glued into a label in one function then condemns an unrelated `value` holding a
real ISO constant in another, and names like `value`, `key`, `iso` and `start`
collide constantly. A rule with that false-positive rate gets suppressed, and a
suppressed rule protects nothing.

ESLint's scope analysis — which oxlint's plugin host implements — resolves the
identifier at the call site to the **one** binding it actually refers to,
honouring shadowing and closures. A same-named variable in a sibling function is
a different `Variable` and is never consulted. The false positive isn't traded
away; it is structurally absent, and `test/fixtures/scope-clean.ts` is built out
of exactly those collisions to keep it that way.

Every write to the resolved binding is checked — the declarator's initialiser
plus every later assignment — and aliases are followed (`const b = a`). One
glued write is enough: a variable that is *sometimes* glued is sometimes wrong,
and which branch ran is not something a linter gets to know.

**Deliberately not checked:** the glued string has to reach the consumer through
a plain binding. Passing it into a helper, storing it on an object, or pushing
it through an array all escape this rule. Following those needs data-flow
analysis rather than scope analysis, and a linter that guesses at data flow
produces exactly the false positives that get rules switched off. Scope
resolution is a real boundary and this rule sits on the near side of it.

### `no-double-assertion`

Bans `x as unknown as T`.

A single `as T` is checked: TypeScript rejects it unless one of the two types
is assignable to the other, so it can narrow or widen but it cannot invent.
Routing through `unknown` removes that check — the compiler stops relating the
two types and simply believes the second annotation. Whatever `T` claims is
then true for every downstream reader, including the ones who typecheck against
it and ship.

The distinction worth keeping is not "more of the same": `as T` is a partly
verifiable claim whose failure mode is a compile error. `as unknown as T` is an
unverified claim whose failure mode is a runtime error in a file that never
mentioned the cast. The usual tell is a comment beside it explaining why the
two types "really are" compatible — prose standing in for a check, and prose
goes stale. One such comment claimed two generated types differed by two
fields; they differed by six.

Instead: name the overlap (`Omit`/`Pick`/an interface) so both shapes satisfy
it with no cast, or narrow with a `value is T` type guard, so the shape is
earned at runtime rather than asserted.

Not matched: `x as T` (checked), `x as unknown` on its own (widening is the
safe direction), and `x as any as T` — `as any` is already caught by
`noExplicitAny` in both linters. The JS flavour additionally matches the
angle-bracket spelling `<T><unknown>x`, which is free once you have a real AST
and is a syntax error in `.tsx` anyway.

⚠️ **This fires in test files too.** Mocks and fixtures are where bridging a
closed generated interface is most defensible, so check whether your test
directories are inside the linted set before adopting it. Under oxlint you can
scope it off for a glob with `overrides`. The better answer is usually to write
the one checked cast inside a helper whose parameter type is *derived from* the
target, so no `unknown` bridge is needed anywhere.

### `no-suppressions`

Bans `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-expect-error`, `@ts-nocheck`,
`biome-ignore`, `eslint-disable*` and `oxlint-disable*`.

"Never suppress, fix the root cause" is a convention almost every codebase
states and almost none enforces, for a mechanical reason: the suppressions are
comments, and most linters give a rule no way to see them. So it has been
enforceable only by review, which lasts as long as the reviewer remembers.
`sourceCode.getAllComments()` makes it enforceable.

**This is not optional if you adopt these rules.** Oxlint's own disable
directives *do* silence custom JS-plugin rules — verified, and covered by
`test/fixtures/suppression.ts`. So adopting the rest without this one trades a
gap in the rules for a gap in the enforcement: every one of them silently
becomes opt-out.

Two honest limits. It **cannot protect itself** — `// oxlint-disable
common-pattern/no-suppressions` works, and oxlint has no `noInlineConfig` to
close that. And it reports its own source file, which mentions every directive
it bans; consumers never see this, because `node_modules` is ignored by default.

### `no-zoneless-locale-format`

Bans rendering a date through `toLocaleDateString` / `toLocaleTimeString` /
`toLocaleString`, or `Intl.DateTimeFormat`, without an explicit `timeZone`.

With no `timeZone`, these format in the **runtime's** zone. That is the
machine's zone — not the user's, not the tenant's — and on a server it is
whatever the container was built with, almost always UTC. So one stored instant
renders as two different wall clocks depending on where the code happens to run.

This is `no-utc-calendar-day`'s failure arriving by the opposite road. There the
zone is silently UTC; here it is silently *ambient*. Both produce code that is
correct in every context anyone inspects it in — a suite pinning `TZ=UTC` agrees
with a UTC container, and a developer sitting in the tenant's zone sees the right
answer all day — and wrong only in what the user is shown.

Instead, pass the zone, always as a named IANA zone (`"Asia/Kolkata"`), never
the offset it currently resolves to (`"+05:30"`):

```ts
date.toLocaleString("en-IN", { dateStyle: "medium", timeZone: TENANT_TZ })
new Intl.DateTimeFormat("en-IN", { timeZone: TENANT_TZ }).format(date)
formatInTimeZone(date, TENANT_TZ, "d MMM yyyy, HH:mm")   // date-fns-tz
```

If you genuinely want the viewer's own zone — a browser-only clock — that is
still worth writing down rather than inheriting. `timeZone:
Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone` says it out loud, and
satisfies the rule because the option is present. Reading the ambient zone that
way is **not** reported: `Intl.DateTimeFormat(…).resolvedOptions()` is
introspection, not rendering, and flagging it would condemn the fix this rule's
own message recommends.

**How the ambiguity is handled.** Only `Date` has `toLocaleDateString` and
`toLocaleTimeString`, so those two are flagged whenever `timeZone` is absent.
`toLocaleString` is the hard one — `Number`, `BigInt`, `Array` and `Date` all
have it, and `(1234.5).toLocaleString()` is perfectly good code. Telling them
apart needs the receiver's *type*, which a syntactic linter does not have. So
the rule does not guess: it flags `toLocaleString` only when the options object
it was handed is already, unmistakably, formatting a date — it carries a
date/time key (`dateStyle`, `timeStyle`, `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`,
`minute`, `weekday`, …) and no `timeZone`.

Not matched, deliberately: a bare `someDate.toLocaleString()` with no options —
a genuine instance the rule cannot see, and the price of never firing on number
formatting. Options behind a variable or a spread are not followed either; that
needs data flow, not syntax. A narrow rule that always means something beats a
broad one that gets suppressed.

## Install

```jsonc
// package.json — pinned to a SHA; see "Why this isn't on npm" below
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@common-pattern/lint": "github:Common-Pattern/lint#<40-char-sha>"
  }
}
```

### With oxlint

```jsonc
// .oxlintrc.json
{
  "jsPlugins": ["./node_modules/@common-pattern/lint/js/index.js"],

  // Explicitly off. `"categories": {}` does NOT disable the default rule set —
  // it leaves ~500 native rules on at warning severity, which is a lot of noise
  // to inherit by accident. Drop this block if you actually want them.
  "categories": {
    "correctness": "off", "perf": "off", "pedantic": "off",
    "restriction": "off", "style": "off", "suspicious": "off"
  },

  // Severity must be set, and must be "error". Warnings do not fail a build,
  // and a rule that has never failed a build is a rule that protects nothing.
  "rules": {
    "common-pattern/no-utc-calendar-day": "error",
    "common-pattern/no-glued-timestamps": "error",
    "common-pattern/no-glued-timestamp-via-variable": "error",
    "common-pattern/no-double-assertion": "error",
    "common-pattern/no-suppressions": "error",
    "common-pattern/no-zoneless-locale-format": "error"
  }
}
```

⚠️ **`jsPlugins` paths resolve relative to the config file, not the working
directory.** Worth knowing before you move the config or invoke oxlint from a
subdirectory.

### With ESLint

The same objects, loaded the ESLint way:

```js
// eslint.config.mjs
import commonPattern from "@common-pattern/lint/js";

export default [
  {
    plugins: { "common-pattern": commonPattern },
    rules: {
      "common-pattern/no-utc-calendar-day": "error",
      "common-pattern/no-glued-timestamps": "error",
      "common-pattern/no-glued-timestamp-via-variable": "error",
      "common-pattern/no-double-assertion": "error",
      "common-pattern/no-suppressions": "error",
      "common-pattern/no-zoneless-locale-format": "error",
    },
  },
];
```

### Check where your linter actually runs

Worth doing before you pick a flavour, and it is a failure this repo has
watched happen. In a monorepo where each package's `lint` script is
`biome check`, an ESLint rule only runs in the packages that separately invoke
ESLint — which may be none of them. A repo-wide rule usually wants a single
root-level invocation over the whole tree, not a per-package one.

**A rule that is never executed looks exactly like a rule that always passes.**
After wiring anything up, plant a violation and watch the lint fail.

### Why this isn't on npm (yet)

Consume it as a pinned git dependency, as above. `pnpm` resolves that to a
codeload tarball at the exact SHA — no clone, no auth, no publish step, and
reproducible.

The trade is that there is no semver: upgrading means editing a 40-character
SHA in every consumer. Fine for one or two; annoying beyond that.

The obvious alternative — GitHub Packages (`npm.pkg.github.com`) — is worse
here: it requires an authentication token even to *read* public packages, so
every consumer's CI and every developer would need a PAT in their `.npmrc` in
order to install a lint plugin.

If the SHA-bumping becomes the annoying part, the answer is npmjs.com, which
needs no token to consume and supports trusted publishing over OIDC from GitHub
Actions (so no long-lived npm token either).

## Tests

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm test
```

Seven fixtures:

| fixture | asserts |
| --- | --- |
| `violations.ts` | 15 diagnostics — the shared corpus |
| `clean.ts` | 0 — the false-positive guard |
| `scope-violations.ts` | 9 — glue reaching a consumer through a variable |
| `scope-clean.ts` | 0 — the name collisions a scope-blind rule would trip on |
| `callsite-shape-gap.ts` | 4 — the `` `${d}T${t}` `` shape, where the time half is itself interpolated |
| `suppression.ts` | 3 — the directives, not the 2 diagnostics they hide |
| `locale-violations.ts` | 11 — zoneless date rendering |
| `locale-clean.ts` | 0 — number formatting, and options the rule cannot see |

The clean halves matter more than the violation halves. A rule that produces
false positives gets suppressed, and a suppressed rule protects nothing. Two of
them are load-bearing in particular: `scope-clean.ts` is why the scope rule is
writable at all, and `locale-clean.ts` is why the locale rule is — it shares a
method name with number formatting, which is everywhere.

## Adding a rule

1. Write it in `js/rules/<name>.js` and register it in `js/index.js`. Put the
   reasoning at the top of the file and explain the *bug it prevents*, not just
   the pattern it matches — the comment is the part that survives contact with
   the next reader.
2. Add cases to a violations fixture **and** a clean one, and bump the counts in
   `test/run.sh`. If the rule can plausibly fire on something innocent, the
   clean fixture is the more important of the two.
3. Add it to the rule table above, to the config snippets in
   [Install](#install), and to `.oxlintrc.json` so this repo lints itself with
   it.
4. **Verify it actually fires** by planting a violation in a real consumer and
   watching the lint fail. Oxlint prints *nothing at all* on a clean run, so
   silence is not evidence — a plugin that failed to load looks exactly like one
   that passed.
