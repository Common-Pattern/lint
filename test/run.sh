# other diagnostic-for-diagnostic.
#
# The clean halves matter more than the violation halves: a date rule that
# produces false positives gets suppressed, and a suppressed rule protects
# nothing. `scope-clean.ts` in particular is why the scope rule is writable at
# all — it is built out of the exact name collisions that make the same rule
# impossible in GritQL.
#
# The parity assertions are the other load-bearing part. Two implementations of
# one rule is how a rule set drifts; `violations.ts` is linted by both tools and
# must produce the same count, so a change to one flavour that is not made to
# the other fails here rather than in someone's diff six months later.
