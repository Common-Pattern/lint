# The clean halves matter more than the violation halves: a rule that produces
# false positives gets suppressed, and a suppressed rule protects nothing.
# `scope-clean.ts` is why the scope rule is writable at all — it is built out of
# the exact name collisions that would sink a name-matching version — and
# `locale-clean.ts` is why the locale rule is writable at all, since it shares a
# method name with number formatting, which is everywhere.
