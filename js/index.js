/**
 * `@common-pattern/lint` — the JavaScript flavour.
 *
 * Six rules, written as plain ESLint rule objects. Oxlint's JS plugin host
 * implements the ESLint v9 rule API, so the same objects run under either
 * linter unmodified; nothing here imports from oxlint or from ESLint.
 *
 * That portability is the point, not a bonus. Oxlint's plugin API is alpha and
 * has no semver, so a rule set that could only ever run under oxlint would be
 * trading one lock-in for another. These move to ESLint by changing the config
 * that loads them, and nothing else.
 *
 * Each rule carries its own reasoning at the top of its file — what bug it
 * prevents, not just what it matches. The README is the shorter tour.
